## Dike Demo Backend
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and is developed as the back-end project for [Dike demonstration](https://github.com/HoniiTro19/dike-demo).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. The back-end service will listen to `localhost:4000`, get the properties file passed in by users, and start [Dike](https://github.com/DBHammer/Dike) benchmarking process.
